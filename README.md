# OnTime: A Pomodoro App With Task Management

Welcome to OnTime â€” a simple Pomodoro app that helps you stay focused and manage your tasks!

This project is currently under development.
I'm also currently learning React, and this app is a small project I'm building for my college subject, Human-Computer Interactions.

The goal of OnTime is to:
- Help users manage their tasks easily
- Stay focused using the Pomodoro technique
- Practice good design and usability principles from what I've learned in class
